PathogenCount.csv contains single worm data for colonization of N2 adult worms on plates of S. enterica-GFP (SE) or S. aureus-GFP (SA)

sim_means_4dist.R script contains (awkward, memory-inefficient) code for generating averages from samples drawn from four different distributions (normal, lognormal, Poisson, exponential) all with expectation mean=1

wormboot.R script contains (awkward, memory-inefficient) code for creating simulated batch-based CFU/worm data by resampling a user-input vector of CFU/worm data
