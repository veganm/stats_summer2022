# Vega lab meeting, summer 2022, week 10
# This week we will discuss the mysteries of where a hypothesis test comes from,
# what a test statistic is, and how it is turned into a p-value
# as we unpack the normal distribution, the chi-squared, and the F test
# so that we can discuss ANOVA and other partitions of variance.
# Background information is from:
#   https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data#z-scores



# As usual we will load the required packages:
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, effectsize, pwr, cowplot, ggpubr)

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#              N(0,1) AND THE Z-TEST
# Recall back in week 5, when we learned to generate and plot out a normal distribution.
# We'll start with that code to learn how a Z test is constructed.

shared_mean<-5 # our data will have the indicated mean
shared_sd<-2 # and variance

# For the normal, start by creating a sequence of values based on population mean and standard deviation
# First we will create the x-axis
c(-4, 4)
c(-4, 4)*shared_sd+shared_mean # what's happening here? hmm.

# then generate & draw simulated data from the normal distribution using 
?stat_function()

# The function pnorm() gives the distribution function for a normal.
# Let's see what this means. 
# Note that lower.tail is a logical;

# We've glossed over something interesting.
# We rescaled the interval in a very particular way using the shared mean and SD.
